                    <p class="text-muted text-left">At La Martinière Girls’ College, Special Education & Counselling sessions provide students with identified disabilities specialized instruction designed to meet their unique learning needs, giving them the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential. It is a purposeful intervention (preventative, remedial or compensatory) designed to overcome or eliminate the obstacles that keep children with disabilities from learning. Some children with disabilities require special accommodations to achieve success while other children must be taught skills to compensate for the existence of a disability. We believe that students flourish when given the tools for success within a caring environment.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> Art has been a part of our life ever since man came to being. For thousands of years, people have been creating, looking at, criticizing, and enjoying art. Being an artist isn’t just about putting pencil to paper, or brush to canvas. Art can and does mean so much more than that, to so many people. Art is a way of seeing the world, a sense of expression, a form of therapy, and sometimes a compulsion we simply must create!

                    Through our website and auction we look forward to providing a platform to young and creative minds.

                    The funds collected for these artworks will help us together bring a change in the lives of the underprivileged people.

                            Welcome to your La Martinière Girls’ Alumni Association, where we support the College’s mission of “Service to Others by improving the lives of vulnerable individuals, families and communities” through several social outreach projects.
                            Headquartered in La Martinière Girls’ College, Lucknow we serve a community that extends the culture of campus to local communities with the help of alumni, several friends & well-wishers of the institution. LMGAA spearheads several and varied programs based on the ever-changing need of the community we serve. A few examples:
                            • Plants for the Planet: The Annual Tree Plantation Drive in schools, local communities and neighbourhoods is a proactive solution-based approach for protecting our environment.
                            • Health Camps: Held annually in underprivileged schools and neighbouring slums it includes Oral Hygiene, Eye Care, Menstrual Hygiene and information on Gynaecological problems for women. Children and parents alike love the free hamper of stationery, toiletries and hygiene kits. A big THANK YOU to the doctors (parents &alumni) who contribute their time, expertise and donate so generously.
